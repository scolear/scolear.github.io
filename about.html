            <h3>What is this place?</h3>
            <p>This site is meant to display and showcase - in arbitrary detail - the electronics projects I have been working on. Not only as a portfolio, but as a way for me to write down thought processes, challenges and frustrations, so that the knowledge I might have gained solidifies.</p>
            <h3>Who is Robert Tera?</h3>
            <p>I wish I would know. All I know is that after finishing my Master's degree in Astronomy, I've gotten more and more interested and involved in physical, practical fields - electronics, tinkering and crafting. There is something incredibly rewarding in having an idea, and then seeing it materialize.</p>
